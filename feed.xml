# Pandasite
Finally, after a long time, 
we're happy to announce and introduce the [Pandasite](https://github.com/panda-lang/pandasite) - 
a new website for panda-lang organization. 
As a part of alpha release cycle, 
we've add some extra sections with interesting content like:
* `News` - regularly posted set of articles about changes and future updates
* `Guide` - simple introduction into the Panda world and its features

It's also time to say goodby to the old one:

# Roadmap of release life cycle
It's time to introduce the precisely defined Panda release life cycle.
The development process is divided into 4 phases and we will describe them in this article.
For the sake of clarity and transparent: we've just entered the 2nd phase - alpha.

Here is a list of all the all phases:
* `indev`
* `alpha`
* `beta`
* `stable`

We've prepared an image to visualize all these phases and plan for them:
