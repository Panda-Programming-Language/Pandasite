# Roadmap of release life cycle
It's time to introduce the precisely defined Panda release life cycle.
The development process is divided into 4 phases and we will describe them in this article.
For the sake of clarity and transparent: we've just entered the 2nd phase - alpha.

Here is a list of all the all phases:
* `indev`
* `alpha`
* `beta`
* `stable`

We've prepared an image to visualize all these phases and plan for them:
