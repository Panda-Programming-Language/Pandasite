# Roadmap of release life cycle

It's time to introduce Panda release life cycle.
The development process is divided into 4 phases and we will describe them in this article.
For the sake of clarity, we've just entered the 2nd phase - alpha.

Here is a list of all phases:

- `indev`
- `alpha`
- `beta`
- `stable`

We've also prepared an image to visualize it and our plans for them:
