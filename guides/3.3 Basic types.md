## Basic types
Data types identifies and describes values used in your code. 
By default, we have types that identifies numbers, texts or logical values.

### ‣ Numbers
Integral numbers are defined by the `Int` type:

```panda
123
-321
```

In the similar way we can use [floating-point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) represented by the `Float` type:

```panda
1.0
-0.1337
```

There are also other number types like `Byte`, `Short`, `Long` and `Double`.
You will learn about them in the future.

### ‣ Text
In programming, the type that describes text is called [String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)). 
As of today, every time you want to use some sequence of characters in your program, you have to call it `String`.
We can declare `String` in two forms:

```panda
// preferred way of declaring strings, 
// we can use quotation marks inside of the apostrophe string
'Michael Scott said "I love inside jokes. I hope to be a part of one someday."'

// useful when we want to use apostrophe in string
"That's what she said"
```

### ‣ Logic
To represent `true` and `false` states we need to use the [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) type.
