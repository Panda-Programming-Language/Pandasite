## Configuration file panda.hjson
This file describes our project and the way how it works. It uses JSON-like format called `'JSON for Humans'`. 
Standard configuration file should contain `name`, `version`, `author` and `main ` key-value properties:

```json
name: awesome-project
version: 1.0.0
owner: dzikoysk

scripts: {
    main: src/app.panda
}
```

You may also declare dependencies by adding the dependencies section:

```json
dependencies: [
    // <source>:<author>/<name>@<version>
    github:dzikoysk/panda-dependency@1.0.1
]
```
