# Expressions
Welcome to the chapter 5 ðŸ¤ .
It's been a while to get here.
You've already learned some expressions...
Wait, we didn't explain what `expression` really is.

To put it simply, `expression` is a statement that returns something as a result.
Some of expressions that we used in previous chapters:

```panda
'Hello'
123
true
10 != 20
index++
new Cat()
cat.name
dog.getName()
```

As you can see, all of them return value that we can e.g. assign to a variable.
In this chapter we will show you other useful built-in expressions.
