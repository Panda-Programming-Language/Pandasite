## Fields
To put it simply, field is just a variable that belongs to the type. 
The pattern that defines fields is as follows:

```xml
{visibility} {type} {name}
```

Let's say we want add field with a name of our cat to store this information:

```panda
type Cat {
    // {visibility} {type} {name}
    public String name

    public constructor(String name) {
        // to distinguish variable name with field name, 
        // we can use 'this.` prefix to indicate field
        this.name = name
    }
}

main {
    Cat garfield = new Cat('Garfield')
    Cat grumpy = new Cat('Grumpy Cat')

    // we can access field 'name', so let's print its value
    log garfield.name, grumpy.name
}
```
