## Log

In a clear way, *logging* is just a fancy word to define a process of writing down what you do.
It is utility statement, used in most cases to display list of expressions to a default output of your application *(e.g. console)*.

```panda
log 'Hello', 'Panda!'
```

Despite this, serious projects should still consider custom logging libraries for a fuller experience.
