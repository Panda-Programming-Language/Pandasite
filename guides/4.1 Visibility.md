## Visibility
In fact, before we will start talking about all the mechanisms associated with types,
we need to introduce the visibility system. 

Visibility allows us to control access to various properties declared by types.
At this moment Panda supports 3 visibilities:

* `public` - we can access these properties wherever we are
* `shared` - only module that owns this type, and its submodules, can access these properties
* `internal` - only type and its inheritors can access these properties

Because of the fact that it might be hard to understand for beginners, 
we will declare every property as `public` for the purposes of the guide.
