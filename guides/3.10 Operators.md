## Operators
Operators are these all strange combinations of `~!=-+:/|()%&*` characters that do some basic stuff like e.g. comparing two values.
This article should be a part of the Chapter 5 about expressions, 
but we need to explain it now to clarify some of the next basic structures.

### ‣ Arithmetic Operators
Returns `Number` as a result of operation

| Operator | Name           | Description                               | Example | 
| -------- | :------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------ | 
| `+`      | Addition       | Adds together two values                  | `x + y` | 
| `-`      | Subtraction    | Subtracts one value from another          | `x - y` | 
| `*`      | Multiplication | Multiplies `x` by `y`                     | `x * y` | 
| `/`      | Division       | Divides `x` by `y`                        | `x / y` | 
| `%`      | Modulus        | Performs modulo operation on `x` and `y`  | `x % y` |
| `++`     | Increment      | Increases the value of a variable by 1    | `i++`   |
| `--`     | Decrement      | Decreases the value of a variable by 1    | `i--`   |

### ‣ Assignment Operators
Returns assigned value as a result

| Operator | Description                    | Example  | 
| -------- | ------------------------------ | -------- | 
| `=`      | Assign value to a variable     | `x = y`  | 
| `+=`     | Add value to a variable        | `x += y` | 
| `-=`     | Subtract value from a variable | `x -= y` | 
| `*=`     | Multiplicate value of variable | `x *= y` | 
| `/=`     | Divide value of variable       | `x /= y` | 

**Remember:** Variables modified by these operators have to be mutable.

### ‣ Comparison Operators
Returns `true` or `false` as a result:

| Operator | Name                     | Example  | 
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------- | 
| `==`     | Equals to                | `x == y` |
| `!=`     | Not equals to            | `x != y` |
| `>`      | Greater than             | `x > y`  |
| `<`      | Less than                | `x < y`  |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `x <= y` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `x >= y` |

### ‣ Logical Operators
Returns `true` or `false` as a result:

| Operator | Name  | Description                           | Example                | 
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | 
| `&&`     | And   | True if both statements are true      | `(x == 0) && (y == 0)` | 
| `||`     | Or    | True if one of the statements is true | `(x == 0) || (y == 0)` | 
| `! `     | Not   | Reverse the result value              | `!(x == 0)`            |
