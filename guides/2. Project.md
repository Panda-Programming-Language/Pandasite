# Project
Projects in Panda should follow the standardized structure. 
Create a directory for your new project called e.g. `awesome-project`:

```bash
$ mkdir awesome-project
$ cd awesome-project
```

Every proper project should contain at least 2 files:
* `panda.cdn` - project configuration file in [CDN](https://github.com/dzikoysk/cdn) (JSON5 like format) with some details about the current project
* `app.panda` - main script file *(Name of this file can be changed in a configuration)*

Let's see how it should look like:

```bash
panda-project/     # project directory
  src/             # sources
    app.panda      # main script file
  tests/           # <concept> integration tests
  resources/       # <concept> non panda files
  panda.cdn      # project configuration file
  README.md        # project description for GitHub and Reposilite pages 
```
