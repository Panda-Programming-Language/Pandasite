title: Base
---

## Base
The main problem in inheritance is to support compatibility of object initialization process. 
Literally speaking, we need to guarantee call to the `base` *(parent)* constructor.

We will use previous example to explain and fix lack of `base` call:
```panda
type Animal {
    constructor (String name) { }
}

type Cat : Animal {

}
```

By default, every type without specified constructor has empty constructor without parameters.
It means that in fact, `Cat` looks like this:

```panda
type Cat : Animal {
    constructor () { }
}
```

As you can see, we have conflict between constructors. 
Calling `new Cat()` we cannot perform `new Animal('name of animal')` due to lack of `name` parameter.
It's time for the `base` statement:

```panda
type Cat : Animal {
    constructor (String name) { 
        base(name) // pass value to parent constructor 
    }
}
```
