# Installation
At this moment we offer two ways to install Panda. The first one is dedicated for users and developers who use and create applications in Panda. The second on is for developers who want to use Panda Framework as a scripting language in theirs applications.

### ‣ General
As we said, Panda runs on JVM *(Java Virtual Machine)*. We have prepared installer with wrapped JVM to get rid of problems related to some kind of invalid/custom installations of an existing machines.

```bash
./panda-installer.exe
```

### ‣ Developers
Panda supports various implementations of JVM and all their versions above 8+
* Oracle HotSpot 
* OpenJDK
* GraalVM *(Native images are not supported yet)*
* DCEVM

As a standard way to serve Java library, we host [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html) artifact located in our own repository called [Panda Repository](https://repo.panda-lang.org/): 

```xml
<repository>
    <id>panda-repository</id>
    <name>Panda Repository</name>
    <url>https://repo.panda-lang.org/</url>
</repository>
```

The artifact may be found as:

```xml
