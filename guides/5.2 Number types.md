## Number types
List of available number types in std:
* `Byte` represents values between `-128 to 127`, defined as `123B`
* `Short` represents values between `-32,768 to 32,767`, defined as `123S`
* `Int` represents values between `-2^31 to 2^31-1`, defined as `123`
* `Long` represents values between `-2^63 to 2^63-1`, defined as `123L`
* `Float` represents values between 32-bit floating point specified in [Java Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html), defined as `123.0F`
* `Double` represents values between 64-bit floating point specified in [Java Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html), defined as `123.0D`

To access primitive wrappers for primitive types, use `Primitive{Type}` types.
It's sometimes necessary during the access to Java API:

```panda
PrimitiveChar[] primitiveArray = '#onlypanda'.toCharArray()
Arrays.sort(primitiveArray)
log new String(primitiveArray)
```
