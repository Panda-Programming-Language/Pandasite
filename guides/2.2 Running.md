## Writing and Running a Panda Program
Panda files always end with `.panda` extension. You could already notice that we've declared our main file in project configuration as `app.panda` in directory `src`, so let's create it now:

```bash
panda@terminal ./project-awesome/
$ mkdir src
$ touch src/app.panda
```

Next, add the following code to your `app.panda` file. You can use your favorite editor like e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

```panda
main {
    log 'Hello, Panda!'
}
```

You can assume that the code that you have already used will print `'Hello, Panda!'` message in the console. Don't worry, we will analyze this code later. Let's check the result - to launch the `awesome-project` you need just one more step:

```bash
panda@terminal ./project-awesome/
$ panda panda.hjson
Hello, Panda!

--- OR: you may call src/app.panda directly (it ignores project configuration file)

$ panda src/app.panda
Hello, Panda!

```

Congratulations! You've officially written a Panda program. That makes you a Panda programmer - welcome!
