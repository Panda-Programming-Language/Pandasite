## Interfaces
The `interface` is a list of requirements that type has to contain.
One type can implement several interfaces.

```panda
interface AnimalType {

    String getAnimalType()
    
}
```

Implementation of interface looks exactly the same as extending another type:

```panda
type Cat : Animal, AnimalType {

    override String getAnimalType() {
        return 'Cat'
    }

}
```

As you can see, we've used strange new keyword - `override`. 
In Panda, we have to mark overridden *(declared by other types)* methods and thanks to that,
we can avoid unintentional overrides.
