## Throw
An [exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling) is an event, 
which occurs during the execution of a program, 
that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. 

What does it mean? 
In case of any unwanted situations (like passing invalid data),
we can interrupt execution of our application using the `throw` keyword.

Let's say we want to make sure that nobody will perform division by zero:

```panda
Int by = 0 // user data

if (by == 0) {
    throw new Exception('Cannot divide by zero') // throw error
}

log 100/by
```

These exceptions are fully compatible with Java exception system.
