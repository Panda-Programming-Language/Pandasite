## Tools

Project is still unstable and there is no official and advanced tools yet. You may take a look at these concepts:
* [Light](https://github.com/panda-lang/light) - English-like programming language built using the Panda Framework
* [Reposilite](https://github.com/panda-lang/reposilite) - Repository management software based on Spring mainly dedicated for Maven and Panda-based artifacts 
* [Lily](https://github.com/panda-lang/lily) - a modular and lightweight IDE for languages based on Panda Framework

We don't recommend to use API of Panda Framework before **beta** release.
