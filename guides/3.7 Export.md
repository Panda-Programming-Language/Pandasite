## Export
To improve overall scripting experience and simplify access to the Java types, you can use the `export` statement. 
The statement works like `import`, but it also publishes the result to the other participants like files and modules that imports this module.

```panda
module extra-java-bindings

// export StringUtils class, the class will be visible in 
export org.panda_lang.utilities.commons.StringUtils
```

It may be helpful during the process of creating wrappers and bindings modules for existing Java apps and libraries.
