## Conditions
Conditions performs different computations or actions depending on a provided value:

```panda
String slogan = 'I’m lovin’ it'

if slogan == 'Taste the rainbow' {
    // do something if the slogan variable is equals to the 'Taste the rainbow' text
}
else if slogan != '' {
    // do something if slogan is not empty
}
else {
    // do something if all of the above conditions hasn't been succeed
}
```

As you might suppose, the `do something if slogan is not empty` section will be performed.
