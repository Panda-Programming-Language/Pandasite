## Static
Fields and methods you've already used in the previous articles were called and accessed using some object instances.
There is also a way to declare properties that do not need an instance to work.
This kind of properties are called `static` and are often used to declare some constant values and utilities.

### ‣ Fields
It is good practice to use uppercase names for static fields:

```panda
type Mars {
    open static Float RADIUS = 3389.5
}

main {
    // we don't need to create instance of Mars
    // to access RADIUS field coz it is static
    log Mars.RADIUS 
}
```

### ‣ Methods
```panda
type Math {
    // find highest value of a and b
    open static max (Int a, Int b) -> Int {
        if (a > b) {
            return a
        }

        return b
    }
}

main {
    // we don't need to create instance of Mars
    // to access max method coz it is static
    log Math.max(-10, 100)
}
```
