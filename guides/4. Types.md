# Types
Types describe values and its behaviors. 
You've already used some of them like `String` and `Bool`. 

It's time to create a new one, let's say a `Cat` type.
To declare a new type, we need to use `type` keyword:

```panda
type Cat {

}
```

To use a new type, you have to create a new instance using the `new {TypeName}()` structure:

```panda
Cat garfield = new Cat()
Cat grumpy = new Cat()
```

In the following articles about `fields`, `methods`, `constructors` and many others, we will enhance this example.

**Remember:** These members of types *(like `fields` or `methods`)* are called `properties`.
