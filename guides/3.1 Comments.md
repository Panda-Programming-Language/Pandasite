## Comments
Comments are statements in our code that the interpreter ignores. 
We generally use them to explain the code. 
It means comments won't be a part of the program and it will not be executed.

```panda
// single line comment

/*
Multiline
Comment
*/

/**
 * Documentation comment
 * It's used to generate documentation of your program in a standardized way
 */
```
