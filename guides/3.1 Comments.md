## Comments
Comments are statements in our code that the interpreter ignores. 
We generally use them to explain the code. 
It means comments will not be the part of the program and it will not be executed.

```panda
// single line comment

/*
Multiline
Comment
*/

/**
 * Documentation comment
 * It's used to generate documentation of your program in a standardized way
 */
```
