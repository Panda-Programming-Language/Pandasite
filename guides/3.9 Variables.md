## Variables
A variable is a symbolic name for your information *(value)*. Every variable must be declared. Any attempt to use a variable that hasn't been declared yet is a syntax error. By default, variables in Panda are:

* *Immutable* - once assigned value cannot be changed in the future
* *Null safety* - you are not allowed to assign [null](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_pointer) (not existing) values

```panda
String message = 'With Great Beard Comes Great Responsibility'
```

### ‣ Mutable
Sometimes there is a need to change/update value of some variables. To make your variable mutable just add `mut` keyword

```panda
mut String messageOfTheDay = 'Productivity'

if true {
    messageOfTheDay = 'Cat Videos'
}
```

### ‣ Nullable
In some evil scenarios you may be also forced to handle null values *(e.g. during the interaction with Java libraries)*. 

```panda
nil String playingWithFire = null
```

**Remember:** You should avoid null values, it is really bad practice to operate directly on a value that in fact does not even exist. Null values are also known as [The Billion Dollar Mistake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare#Apologies_and_retractions). Panda supports `null` values only because of the compatibility requirements with Java layer.

### ‣ Late
Let's say you want to assign value to a variable a little later due to e.g. some kind of condition. 
You may use `late` keyword to have a guarantee that the variable was assigned before its usage. 
You can also still benefit from the immutability of this variable.

```panda
late String conditionalValue

if true {
    conditionalValue = 'a'
}
else {
    conditionalValue = 'b'
}
```
