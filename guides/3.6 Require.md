## Require
As you could see, we can define modules related to some parts of our application. 
It is a standard way to distribute utilities by libraries, to use delivered components we need to import them using the following structure:

```panda
// import java collections from std/module path
require java:collections

// import 'local-module' module in directory ./local-module
require 'local-module'
```

The require statement supports also single files:

```panda
// import './local-file.panda' file
require 'local-file'
```
