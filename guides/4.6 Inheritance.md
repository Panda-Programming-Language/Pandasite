## Inheritance
Inheritance is a concept where we can share common properties between various types.

We've already defined type `Cat`. 
If we'd like to create a new type `Dog` that behaves exactly like `Cat`, we could just copy-paste its content.
It is a little silly and exhausting solution, especially in larger projects.

Let's think about common characteristics of `Cat` and `Dog`. 
For instance, they're both animals, so it is time to create the `Animal` type:

```panda
type Animal {
    internal String name

    constructor (String name) {
        this.name = name
    }

    open getName () -> String {
        return this.name
    }
}
```

To inherit `Animal` we need to `extend` it using the `type {Name} : {Type to extend}`:

```panda
type Cat : Animal { }

type Dog : Animal { }
```

VoilÃ ! ðŸ¥– 

**Note:** Unfortunately, we can `extend` only one type. 
This limitation is a result of problems that comes with a various conflicts between shared properties.
