## Concatenation
String [concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation) is the operation of joining string values.

```panda
log 'We can add values ' + "as strings and even other objects like"
```

We can also concatenate other types:

```panda
log 'Value: ' + 1000
```

You should be careful, for instance let's consider this case:

```panda
log 'ðŸ¤”: ' + 1 + 2
```

The following code prints `ðŸ¤”: 12`. 
To avoid strange behaviors we stringify all the parameters without exceptions. 
To perform some kind of custom actions like math operations, 
you have to wrap the operation into the `( )` brackets:

```panda
log 'ðŸ¤”: ' + (1 + 2)
```
