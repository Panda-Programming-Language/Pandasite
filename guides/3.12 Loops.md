## Loops
Loops are used to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied.
Panda supports 4 types of loops at this moment.

### ‣ Loop
You can just easily loop `x` times using the standard `loop` statement:

```panda
loop 5 {
    log 'ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ' // this code will be performed 5 times
}
```

### ‣ For
The most popular for-loop in almost every programming language. The pattern of `for` syntax is as follows:

```panda
for (initialization; termination condition; increment) {
    statement(s)
}
```

* *initialization* - you can declare auxiliary variable here. It's executed only once, as the loop begins 
* *termination condition* - as long as this condition is `true`, the loop will be performed
* *increment* - this expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop

An example implementation of this statement might looks like:

```panda
for (mut Int index = 1; index < 2; index++) {
    log index
}
```

**Note:** You can also skip some of these expressions or even all of them:

```panda
for (;;) {
    log 'What's happening?!'
}
```

You've just created the infinite loop! 

### ‣ For each
You can also use `foreach` loop to iterate over iterable structures (in most cases just collections):

```panda
foreach (String element : collection) { 
    log element
}
```

### ‣ While
Another popular loop called while-loop. 
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```panda
mut active = true

while active {
    log 'Active: ' + (active = false)
}
```

**Note:** As an alternative to infinite loops based on `for (;;) { }`, you can just use `while true {  }` ✧ʕ̢̣̣̣̣̩̩̩̩·͡˔·ོɁ̡̣̣̣̣̩̩̩̩✧
